  <h2>What is Engine Light?</h2>

  <p>
  <a href="http://github.com/codeforamerica">CfA has lots of projects</a>. These projects are written in different languages, hosted in different places, and have different levels of complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
  Engine Light surfaces a small set of app details and monitors an app’s state. This basic set of functionality lets users know if an app is okay or not. 
  </p>

  <p>
  To display app information or check the app’s state, Engine Light fetches JSON via the app’s status API endpoint from <code>/.well-known/status</code>. Here’s an example of what a JSON response would look like:
  </p>

<pre style="margin-left: 1em">{
  "status": "ok",
  "updated": 1380064049,
  "dependencies": [ "Postgres", "Sendgrid" ],
  "resources": { "Sendgrid": 17.85 }
}</pre>

  <p>
  <var>Status</var> may contain either "ok" or an error message. The app determines what an errored state is. <var>Updated</var> is a unix timestamp indicating when the status check occurred by the app. <var>Dependencies</var> are third party services the app uses and <var>resources</var> are third party services or data stores with usage limitations. An app sends current resource usage information as a percentage.
  </p>
